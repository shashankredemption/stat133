Function 1
5/5

Function 2
4/5
Replacing line 29 with 
  chvec <- unlist(strsplit(gsub("[^[:digit:] ]", " ", chvec), " +"))
yields a workable solution (although the max it returns will be a character
rather than numeric but that is OK)

Function 3
4/5
This misses some cases e.g. “he saw him” -> “he saw him”

Function 4
3/5
There are syntax errors and because you use which.max your code 
would note account for tied most common letters.
