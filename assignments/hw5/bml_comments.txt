	This was indeed quite an interesting experiment. While exploring, I was able to see that there were three possible things that could happen within the model: 1) gridlock, where no “car” could move in any direction, 2) looping, where the cars go in a repeating pattern that will never result in gridlock, or some sort of other thing that was unable to decipher in the initial 10,000 runs. As anyone could have predicted, the more cars there are in the plane, the more traffic, and thus, the more likely it is that the cars reach gridlock. Interestingly enough, it does seem like 50% is about the golden number for reaching gridlock. This does make sense, because if more than half of the grid is full, then it would make sense that at least half of the tiles are full, which would definitely lead to gridlock. Another interesting thing is that despite having 10,000 runs at 10x10 grids, all gridlock resulted within the first 250 runs, or else it never occurs. This is probably due to the size I selected, because after a while it is likely that it is just repeating.
